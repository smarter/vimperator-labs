Priority list:
1-9 as in vim (9=required for next release, 5=would be nice, 1=probably not)

BUGS:
- switching tabs while HINT_MODE_ALWAYS is on does not redisplay hints in new tabs, but exits hint mode
- hints are not placed correctly when zoom is used
- flashing frame is not perfect
- The RSS feed button in the address bar no longer works.
- autoupdate does not work

FEATURES:
9 marks of a Location (also should work with directories), [m a-zA-Z] to set it, [' a-zA-Z] to go there
  [m 0-9] marks a buffer instead [' 0-9] goes there
  also mark bookmarks (with mA-Z maybe and use only lowercase marks for inbuffer marks?)
  also support :mark and :marks
8 :cd .. -> Up one directory, :cd goes to top location, [Backspace] command shortcut, use count (:3cd goes 3 levels up)
8 downloading of links to filesystem (:save <filename>)
8 provide a buffer on the bottom where more than 1 line messages can be shown, preferrable
  with color support (for things like :ls)
8 middleclick in content == p, and if command line is open, paste there the clipboard buffer
8 [ctrl-o/i] to Go back to a Previous Position (done partly, however currenty does not use a per tab jumplist)
8 Use our own find-as-you-type mechanism (like conkeror does)
8 A way to temporaily disable vimperator keys (for sites like gmail)
7 make hints smarter, not only with characters from from hintchars, but use "NE" or "NP" for 'new posts' e.g. (might be too slow)
7 whereever possible: get rid of dialogs and ask console-like dialog questions or write error prompts directly on the webpage or with :echo()
7 :hardcopy -> printing
7 Ctrl-6/Ctrl-^ -> jump to the previously active tab
7 :b[uffer] <name> should switch to a buffer/tab
  :b[uffer] - show buffers, if argument is number, switch to this tab, if url, open tab with this url
  buffer Switching also after pressing 'b' and typing _any_ part of the buffer name?
7 3d should delete 3 tabs
6 :map commands to keys
6 autocommands (BrowserStart, BrowserQuit, TabClose, TabOpen, TabChanged, PageLoaded, any more?)
6 vim like mappings for caret mode and textboxes (i to start caret mode?)
6 pipe selected text/link/website to an external command
6 macros (qq)
6 :ls - show buffers
6 support firefox search engines
6 gf = view source?
6 make a real one-tab-mode, divert _all_ other targets, possible by setting a firefox option (set popup=0-3)
6 Shift-Insert in textboxes pastes clipboard contents
5 Use arrow keys in preview window
5 Sort :open completion by date?
5 make use of the ] and [ keys to e.g. jump to the next heading ]], next image ]i, previous textbox [t and so on
5 add tag support to adding/deleting bookmarks
4 Support multiple top-level windows?
4 :restart command to restart firefox
3 Splitting Windows with [:sp :vsp ctrl-w,s ctrl-w,v] and closing with [ctrl-w,q], moving with [ctrl-w,w or tab]
  have a look into the split browser extension
3 :set should also set about:config options (with autocomplete)
