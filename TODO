Priority list:
1-9 as in vim (9=required for next release, 5=would be nice, 1=probably not)

BUGS:
- switching tabs while HINT_MODE_ALWAYS is on does not redisplay hints in new tabs, but exits hint mode
- flashing frame is not perfect
- The RSS feed button in the address bar no longer works.
- autoupdate does not work
- multiple windows to not work at all, so :q will close the whole browser session, even when there are other windows which has tabs
- reload/stop buttons don't update enabled state

FEATURES:
9 marks of a Location, [m a-zA-Z] to set it, [` a-zA-Z] to go there
  [m 0-9] marks a buffer instead [' 0-9] goes there
  also mark bookmarks (with M[a-zA-Z] maybe and use only lowercase marks for inbuffer marks?)
  also support :mark and :marks
8 :open .. -> Up one directory, :cd goes to top location, [Backspace] command shortcut, use count (:3cd goes 3 levels up)
8 downloading of links to filesystem (:save <filename>)
8 provide a buffer on the bottom where more than 1 line messages can be shown, preferrable
  with color support (for things like :ls)
8 middleclick in content == p, and if command line is open, paste there the clipboard buffer
8 [ctrl-o/i] to Go back to a Previous Position (done partly, however currenty does not use a per tab jumplist)
8 Use our own find-as-you-type mechanism (like conkeror does)
7 make hints smarter, not only with characters from from hintchars, but use "NE" or "NP" for 'new posts' e.g. (might be too slow)
7 whereever possible: get rid of dialogs and ask console-like dialog questions or write error prompts directly on the webpage or with :echo()
7 :hardcopy -> printing
7 Ctrl-6/Ctrl-^ -> jump to the previously active tab
7 3d should delete 3 tabs
6 :map commands to keys
6 autocommands (BrowserStart, BrowserQuit, TabClose, TabOpen, TabChanged, PageLoaded, any more?)
6 vim like mappings for caret mode and textboxes (i to start caret mode?)
6 pipe selected text/link/website to an external command
6 macros (qq)
6 support firefox search engines, or at least make our search enginges user configurable
6 gf = view source?
6 make a real one-tab-mode, divert _all_ other targets, possible by setting a firefox option (set popup=0-3)
6 Shift-Insert in textboxes pastes selection contents
6 page info support (ctrl-g, g<C-g>)
5 Use arrow keys in preview window
5 Sort :open completion by date?
5 make use of the ] and [ keys to e.g. jump to the next heading ]], next image ]i, previous textbox [t and so on
5 add tag support to adding/deleting bookmarks
4 change :exec to behave more vim like, and add a seperate :javascript << EOF command
4 Support multiple top-level windows?
3 Splitting Windows with [:sp :vsp ctrl-w,s ctrl-w,v] and closing with [ctrl-w,q], moving with [ctrl-w,w or tab]
  have a look into the split browser extension
3 :set should also set about:config options (with autocomplete)

RANDOM IDEAS:
* numbered tabs
* make hints work with usermode
* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125 - use vim to edit text fields
* Would it be possible to add a setting "maxcompletionsshown" and 
  "maxpreviewwindowheight" or something like this?
